To function this code:

1. When you run the code, it opens a file in the Command Prompt while the program is running.
2. The Command Prompt provides a menu with numbered options for the user to choose from.
3. In this situation, the first step is to encrypt the code, so the user would select option 1.
4. Consequently, the program processes the input provided by the user.
5. Users can also opt to view both the encrypted and decrypted files by choosing the respective numbered commands.
6. Encrypted files are stored with a .crp extension, while decrypted files have a .txt extension.
7. The application will continue to run until the user is satisfied with the encryption/decryption settings for their files.
